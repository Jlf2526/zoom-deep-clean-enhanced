# PySide6 Migration Guide & Performance Analysis

## 🚀 Overview

This document outlines the migration from Tkinter to PySide6 and the performance optimizations implemented to address identified bottlenecks.

## 📊 Performance Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. **File System Scanning (Major Bottleneck)**
**Problem:**
- Sequential `find` commands across multiple directories
- Each location searched individually with 180-second timeouts
- No parallel processing or async operations
- Searches entire `/Library`, `/System/Library`, `/private/var`, `/Applications`, and all user directories

**Impact:**
- Cleanup can take 15-30 minutes on systems with many files
- CPU underutilization (single-threaded scanning)
- Poor user experience with no progress feedback

**Solution:**
- Implemented `AsyncFileScanner` with parallel directory scanning
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` with configurable worker count
- Smart directory filtering to skip irrelevant paths
- Pattern-based Zoom file detection for faster matching
- Progress callbacks for real-time user feedback

### 2. **Process Management Inefficiency**
**Problem:**
- Sequential process termination without batching
- Multiple `pgrep` and `ps` calls for verification
- VM service stopping is synchronous

**Impact:**
- Slow process cleanup (5-10 seconds per process)
- Multiple system calls for the same information
- Inefficient resource usage

**Solution:**
- Implemented `OptimizedProcessManager` with batch operations
- Single `pgrep` command to find all Zoom processes
- Batch termination with graceful SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL
- Process caching to avoid redundant system calls

### 3. **GUI Threading Issues**
**Problem:**
- Tkinter implementation runs cleanup in separate threads but updates GUI synchronously
- No proper async/await patterns for long-running operations
- Screen tearing and UI freezing during intensive operations

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience with frozen interface
- No real-time progress updates
- Difficult to cancel operations

**Solution:**
- Modern PySide6 implementation with proper threading
- Async operations with progress reporting
- Non-blocking UI updates with signal/slot architecture
- Cancellable operations with proper cleanup

### **Key Performance Optimizations:**

#### **Parallel File Scanning**
```python
# Before: Sequential scanning
for location in search_locations:
    find_command = ["find", location, "-iname", "*zoom*"]
    success, output = self._run_command(find_command, timeout=180)

# After: Parallel scanning
async def scan_directories_parallel(self, directories: List[str]) -> List[ScanResult]:
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(self.scan_directory_sync, dir) for dir in directories]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*futures)
```

#### **Batch Process Management**
```python
# Before: Individual process termination
for process in zoom_processes:
    subprocess.run(['kill', str(process.pid)])

# After: Batch termination
def terminate_processes_batch(self, processes: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    pids = [p['pid'] for p in processes]
    subprocess.run(['kill', '-TERM'] + [str(pid) for pid in pids])
```

#### **Smart Directory Filtering**
```python
def should_skip_directory(self, dir_path: str) -> bool:
    """Skip irrelevant directories for performance"""
    excluded_dirs = {
        '.Trash', 'Library/Caches', 'Time Machine Backups',
        '.git', 'node_modules', '__pycache__'
    }
    return any(excluded in dir_path for excluded in excluded_dirs)
```
