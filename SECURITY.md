# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions of Zoom Deep Clean Enhanced:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.4.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.2.x   | :x:                |
| < 2.2   | :x:                |

## Security Model

Zoom Deep Clean Enhanced is designed with security as a primary consideration:

### Defensive Security Features
- **Dry-run mode**: Test operations without making system changes
- **Permission validation**: Verifies user permissions before executing sensitive operations
- **Input sanitization**: All user inputs and file paths are validated
- **Secure file operations**: Uses safe file handling practices
- **VM detection**: Identifies virtualized environments for appropriate security measures
- **System integrity**: Preserves system stability during cleanup operations

### Security Boundaries
This tool operates within the following security boundaries:
- **User-level permissions**: Operates only with the permissions of the executing user
- **macOS sandbox compatibility**: Designed to work within macOS security restrictions
- **No privilege escalation**: Does not attempt to gain elevated privileges
- **Read-only system areas**: Respects system integrity protection (SIP)

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:

- **Primary Contact**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub
  - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/PHLthy215/zoom-deep-clean-enhanced/security)
  - Click "Report a vulnerability"
  - Fill out the security advisory form

- **Alternative Contact**: Email PHLthy215@example.com with subject line "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"

### What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

1. **Vulnerability Description**: Clear description of the security issue
2. **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Proposed Solution**: If you have ideas for fixes (optional)
6. **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include PoC code (responsibly)

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Zoom Deep Clean Enhanced:

1. **Always test first**: Use dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) before actual cleanup
2. **Review operations**: Check what the tool will do before proceeding
3. **Keep updated**: Use the latest version for security fixes
4. **Backup important data**: Create backups before running deep cleanup
5. **Run with minimal privileges**: Don't run with unnecessary elevated permissions
6. **Verify downloads**: Only download from official sources (PyPI, GitHub releases)

### For Contributors

When contributing to the project:

1. **Security review**: All pull requests undergo security review
2. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure
4. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for vulnerabilities
5. **Code analysis**: Use static analysis tools to identify potential security issues
6. **Documentation**: Document security considerations in code comments

## Known Security Considerations

### System Access Requirements
- Requires read access to user Library directories
- May require Full Disk Access on macOS for comprehensive cleanup
- Accesses system commands for process management

### File Operations
- Modifies and deletes files in user directories
- Creates temporary files during operations
- Accesses system logs and preference files

### Network Operations
- Downloads Zoom installer from official sources
- Validates download integrity
- No other network communications

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions and announced through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- PyPI package updates

Users are encouraged to enable GitHub notifications for security advisories.

## Threat Model

### In Scope
- Input validation vulnerabilities
- File system security issues
- Process injection attacks
- Information disclosure
- Privilege escalation attempts

### Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access to the system
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Third-party application vulnerabilities
- Issues in dependencies (report to respective maintainers)

## Security Research

We welcome security research on this project. When conducting security research:

1. **Follow responsible disclosure principles**
2. **Do not access data beyond what's necessary for research**
3. **Do not impact other users or systems**
4. **Document findings thoroughly**
5. **Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure**

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Issues**: Use GitHub Security Advisories
- **Security Questions**: PHLthy215@example.com
- **General Issues**: Use GitHub Issues (for non-security bugs)
